# H1_ERP_System
 Hovedforløb 1 - ERP System


  DESCRIPTION:

  This is an ERP System(Console App) for a small company called Planet Tools. They need a database that they can 
  keep track of orders and clients. 
 
  It is our main project for Hovedforløb 1 at TECHCOLLEGE and it combines some of our subjects like 
  Basic Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Database Programming. 


  GOALS:

  - Create a database using SQLite 
   STATUS: WIP(Working), you need to change paths PlanetTools_Database.cs for it to work

  - Make my CRUD and print tables methods as reusable as possible. 
   STATUS: WIP(20%)

  - Create the database, tables and data seeds from a script 
   STATUS: WIP(The tables and the data seeding is working)

  - Print and format the tables for a userfriendly experience 
   STATUS: DONE

  - Implement user action GUI with backend functions
   STATUS: DONE (I just need the methods, will be added when they are optimized)


  IDE, TOOLS AND PROGRAMS:

  - System.Data.SQLite (NuGet package in VS2019)

  - SSMS (For the E/R Diagram)

  - DBBrowser - SQLite (I used it to confirm that my script did what it was supposed to do)

  - Notepad++ (For scripts and text files)

  - Visual Studio 2019 (Console App, .NET 5.0, C#)

  
  NICE TO KNOW'S:

  - My E/R Diagram and Class Diagram can be found in the ERP_Diagrams folder

  - My database class and script can be found in the ERP_Database folder
